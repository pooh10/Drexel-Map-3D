    <h2>About Our Project</h2>
    <p>Drexel University's campus can be a confusing place to navigate, even for those who have been here for years.<br><br>
        There are dozens of academic buildings, food places, recreational centers, and more.<br><br>
        The Drexel University 3D Map project aimed to create detailed 3D models of all Drexel University buildings, offering an innovative way to explore our campus while showcasing its architectural diversity.
          <br><br>
    	We've created detailed 3D models of all Drexel buildings, providing an immersive experience 
    for students, faculty, and visitors. <br><br></p>
